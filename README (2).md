- **CLIP / GPT-4V** for image/sketch-based scene refinement
- **Three.js** for rendering
- **Prompt templates** for dynamic effects like lighting and animation

## ðŸ”§ Workflow
1. **Input Layer** â€“ Text, voice, or sketch input.
2. **AI Engine** â€“ Generates code and visuals from prompts.
3. **UI Layer** â€“ Live 3D preview, drag-and-drop editing, scene explanations.
4. **Export Options** â€“ One-click publish via Netlify/Vercel or download ZIP/GitHub repo.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features
