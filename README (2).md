# 🌐 3DVERSE: ZeroCode3D – Create 3D Websites with Just Text or Voice

3DVERSE is a revolutionary Gen-AI-powered platform that lets anyone create immersive **3D websites** using **natural language** — no coding required. Whether you're a creator, marketer, freelancer, or educator, 3DVERSE empowers you to build dynamic 3D web experiences through text, voice, or image prompts.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Creating 3D websites currently requires expert knowledge in tools like **Three.js** or **Blender**, making it complex, expensive, and inaccessible for non-technical users. Even modern no-code platforms like Webflow or Wix lack true 3D support and remain limited to 2D design.

---

## 🎯 Target Audience

- **Digital creators**
- **Freelancers & marketers**
- **Educators & content studios**
- **Small & Medium Businesses (SMBs)**  
Anyone who wants powerful 3D websites **without code or developer dependency**.

---

## 🤖 Use of Generative AI

3DVERSE uses advanced AI models to automate the entire 3D website creation workflow:

- **GPT-4**: Converts natural language into HTML, CSS, JS, and Three.js code.
- **Whisper**: Enables voice-to-3D website generation.
- **CLIP / GPT-4V**: Understands visual references, like sketches or uploaded images.
- **Smart Prompt Templates**: Pre-built logic for animations, transitions, camera motion, and lighting.

---

## ⚙️ Solution Framework

### 🔹 Input Layer
- **Text prompt**: e.g., _"A fantasy homepage with a 3D castle and mist."_
- **Voice input** via Whisper
- **Image/sketch upload** (optional)

### 🔹 GenAI Engine
- Uses **LLMs** to build full 3D scenes using:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Three.js / Spline-like logic
- **Auto-generates** layout, animation, lighting, camera movement
- Fixes common issues (missing lights, overlapping objects)

### 🔹 User Interface
- **Real-time 3D Preview** in the browser
- **Drag-and-Drop Editing**: adjust objects, change animations
- **Explain Scene**: Describes what the scene/code does in plain English
- **Voice Edit**: Say things like _“Make it night”_ or _“Add rain”_ to dynamically change the scene

### 🔹 Export & Share
- **One-click export** to:
  - ZIP file
  - GitHub Repo
  - Deploy to Netlify or Vercel
- (Upcoming) Webflow/Shopify plugins
