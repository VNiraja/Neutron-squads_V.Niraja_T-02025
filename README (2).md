# 🌐 3DVERSE:   Create 3D Websites with Just Text or Voice

3DVERSE is a revolutionary Gen-AI-powered platform that lets anyone create immersive **3D websites** using **natural language** — no coding required. Whether you're a creator, marketer, freelancer, or educator, 3DVERSE empowers you to build dynamic 3D web experiences through text, voice, or image prompts.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Creating 3D websites currently requires expert knowledge in tools like **Three.js** or **Blender**, making it complex, expensive, and inaccessible for non-technical users. Even modern no-code platforms like Webflow or Wix lack true 3D support and remain limited to 2D design.

---

## 🎯 Target Audience

- **Digital creators**
- **Freelancers & marketers**
- **Educators & content studios**
- **Small & Medium Businesses (SMBs)**  
Anyone who wants powerful 3D websites **without code or developer dependency**.

## 🤖 Use of Generative AI

3DVERSE uses advanced AI models to automate the entire 3D website creation workflow:

- **GPT-4**: Converts natural language into HTML, CSS, JS, and Three.js code.
- **Whisper**: Enables voice-to-3D website generation.
- **CLIP / GPT-4V**: Understands visual references, like sketches or uploaded images.
- **Smart Prompt Templates**: Pre-built logic for animations, transitions, camera motion, and lighting.
